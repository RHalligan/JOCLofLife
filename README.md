# JOCLofLife
GPU accelerated Conway's game of life using JOCL.

Based off of the Mandelbrot sample found at http://www.jocl.org/samples/samples.html


Left mouse click toggles a cell between live and dead

Right mouse click toggles the simulation on and off

Scrolling the mouse wheel goes through the simulation one step at a time


This project was created and developed with the Eclipse IDE
